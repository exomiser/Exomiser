/**
 * Interface for encapsulating data involved in a disease/animal model to human
 * gene association. This interface defines the common features of a model -
 * gene and disease models are somewhat different otherwise.
 * <p>
 * For example the disease Pfeiffer syndrome (OMIM:101600) has a set of defined
 * phenotypes encoded using HPO terms is associated with two causative genes,
 * FGFR1 (Entrez:2260) and FGFR2 (Entrez:2263).
 * <p>
 * There are also mouse models where the mouse homologue of FGFR1 and FGFR2 have
 * been knocked-out and they too have a set of defined phenotypes. However, the
 * mouse phenotypes are encoded using the MPO.
 * <p>
 * Due to the phenotypic similarities of the mouse knockout and/or the human
 * disease it is possible to infer a likely causative gene for a given set of
 * input phenotypes.
