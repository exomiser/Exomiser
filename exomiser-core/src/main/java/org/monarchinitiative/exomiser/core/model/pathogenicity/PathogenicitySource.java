/**
 * Enum representing the pathogenicity prediction method/database used to
 * calculate a given score.
 *
 * CAUTION! REVEL scores tend to be more nuanced and frequently lower thant either the default variant effect score
 * or the other predicted path scores, yet apparently are more concordant with ClinVar. However we do not yet recommend
 * using REVEL either in isolation of with other pathogenicity predictors as the REVEL scores tend to be overwhelmed by
 * the other scores. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
