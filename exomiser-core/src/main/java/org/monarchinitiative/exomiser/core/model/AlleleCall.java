/**
 * Representation of the call state of an allele. Crucially this differs from the HTSJKD because the exomiser does not
 * represent multiple alleles at the same position in the same way. So in most simple cases the allele is either a
 * ref (0), alt (1) or a no call (.) however for genotypes reported as a 1/2 in a VCF file they will be represented in
 * exomiser as a -/1 where the '-' indicates a genotype in conjunction with another allele at this position.
