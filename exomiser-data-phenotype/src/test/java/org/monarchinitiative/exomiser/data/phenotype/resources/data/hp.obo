Therefore, a low urine potassium can suggest gastrointestinal potassium loss, poor dietary intake, or a shift of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space. On the other hand, a high urine potassium in the face of low serum potassium indicated renal loss, referred to as renal potassium wasting.

comment: Palatal width is measured as the distance between the maxillary first permanent molar on the right and left sides, at the lingual cervical line, using a specific device. Palate width is typically assessed subjectively in routine clinical practice. Narrowing is often associated with a High palate, but this should be assessed and coded separately. Gingival overgrowth can give the impression of a narrow palate but should be distinguished and coded separately. The term gothic palate is used to indicate that the roof of the palate is not round but rather has an inverted V-shape, and therefore, only the upper part of the palate is narrow.

comment: Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms also have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Brachycephaly is distinct from Flat occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately.

The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.

comment: Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. The term acrocephaly (or oxycephaly) is used when there is turricephaly and the top of the skull assumes a cone shape.

def: "An `abnormality of skull shape` (HP:0002648) characterized by a `increased anterior-posterior diameter` (PATO:0002043), i.e., an increased antero-posterior dimension of the skull. Cephalic index less than 76%. Alternatively, an apparently increased antero-posterior length of the head compared to width. Often due to premature closure of the sagittal suture." [HPO:probinson, pmid:19125436]
comment: Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Dolichocephaly is distinct from Prominent occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately. Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped).

Normal values for the frequency of smooth philtrum are available. Grading of the smoothness of the philtrum, used in the assessment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, has been developed. This finding is greatly influenced by the facial expression, and care should be taken to evaluate the philtrum when the face is in a neutral position. A smooth philtrum can be associated with a Long philtrum. However, the two findings should be coded separately.

comment: Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

def: "Anterior and inferior folding of the upper portion of the ear that obliterates triangular fossa and scapha." [HPO:probinson, pmid:19152421]
comment: The term 'lop ear' refers to excessive protrusion of the ear from the side of the head, that is, the external ear stands away from the head at a greater than normal angle (Normal angle of the auricle to the median plane averages 25 degrees in boys and 18 degrees in girls). Lop ears are usually larger than normal ears. Mild forms are limited to the superior ear, more severe forms affect the superior and posterior ear. The concha may be excessively concave. This should be distinguished from an Overfolded helix where the external contour of the ear is normal.

Smooth pursuit, or just pursuit, is a class of rather slow eye movements that minimizes retinal target motion. Saccades are rapid eye movements that align the fovea with the target. Slow-pursuit eye movements are involved in tracking a slowly moving target after the saccadic system has placed the image of the target on the fovea.

comment: The diagnosis of oligodontia requires a radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al, 2001].

def: "`Decreased size` (PATO:0000587) of the `teeth` (FMA:12516), which can be defined as a mesiodistal tooth diameter (width) more than 2 SD below mean. Alternatively, an apparently decreased maximum width of tooth." [HPO:ibailleulforestier, pmid:19125428]
comment: Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.

comment: Nerve conduction velocity is usually measured with surface electrodes placed on the skin over nerves at various locations. Following stimulation at one electrode, the speed at which the signal is propagated to other electrodes is recorded. Abnormal values may suggest demyelination, a conduction block, or axonopathy.

comment: If the kidneys sense reduced renal blood flow, as can happen with reduced blood pressure, they secrete renin into the blood, where it reacts with angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Both angiotensin I and II are vasoconstrictors. Angiotensin II additionally leads to the production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, which in turn leads to an increase in blood volume.

comment: Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs most commonly secondary to chronic renal failure. Other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include osteomalacia, rickets, and malabsorption. The pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism results from abnormalities in the renal tubular absorption of phosphate with reduced phosphate excretion and hyperphosphatemia, as well as impaired renal conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferal to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which in turn leads to a decrease in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In combination, elevated serum phosphate levels and reduced vitamin D production result in decreases in serum calcium levels or hypocalcemia, leading to hyperparathyroidism.

comment: This term is kept in the HPO for now as 'ectodermal dysplasia' has been recorded as a phenotypic of other disorders such as DEAFNESS WITH ANHIDROTIC ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA (MIM125050). Nevertheless it is preferable to use precise descriptions of the phenotypic abnormalities and this term should not be used for new annotations. It will be made obsolete in the future.

comment: Hand clenching is commonly characterized by malpositioning of the fingers characterized by radial deviation of the 4th and 5th digits and ulnar deviation of the 2nd digit over the 3rd finger. Hand clenching is distinguished from Camptodactyly, as that term may describe fewer than five digits of a eudactylous hand and does not involve the MCPJ. The digits may overlap when they lie flexed in the palm. It is not necessary to specify the overlapping fingers finding separately.

The bulk of the muscle mass around the base of the thumb is diminished, and there may be a mild concavity over the volar aspect of the first metacarpal. When the deficiency is unilateral, comparison between the two hands will point up the often-subtle change in contour of the thenar muscles. If the degree of involvement is severe, the palm may taper in width proximally.

def: "A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age." [DDD:hvfirth, HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

comment: It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

comment: Note that the girth may be increased in a broad finger, but this must be distinguished from Macrodactyly, because there the length is also increased. This distinction can be subtle. This term should not be used when the increased width is limited to the distal phalanges, instead use Broad fingertips. The affected digit should be specified by the numbering scheme in the introduction. This term is not used for the first digit, see Broad thumbs. When a thumb and one or more fingers are affected, it may be more economical to specify "Broad fingers, F1-5" instead of separately specifying "Broad thumb" and "Broad fingers F2-5".

Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.

Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.

In many cases there is associated volume overload present due to tricuspid regurgitation, in the absence of this, septal motion is normal." [HPO:probinson]

comment: During the development of the heart, the outflow tract initially connects exclusively with the primitive right ventricle and must undergo extensive remodelling to divide into a separate pulmonary artery and aorta; subsequently, there is continued remodelling to establish direct continuity from the left ventricle to the aorta. DORV encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic arrangements and pathophysiologic disturbances. At one end of the spectrum, it mimics tetralogy of Fallot in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, or a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the absence of such stenosis. At the other end of the spectrum, it behaves like transposition of the great arteries with a VSD.

def: "An abnormality of the functioning of the vestibular apparatus." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.

comment: Clubfoot is a complex, multifactorial deformity with genetic and intrauterine factors. One popular theory postulates that a clubfoot is a result of intrauterine maldevelopment of the talus that leads to adduction and plantarflexion of the foot. On radiographic projection a clubfoot can be noted as parallel axes of talus and calcaneus.

comment: No objective standard for nail thickness could be identified. An unsupported claim suggests that nails are 0.5 mm in females and 0.6 mm in males. Thin nails are usually brittle, may easily fray, or break at the free edge. Thin nails usually grow slowly but this definition does not require slow growth of the nail. Note that the term koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave. Since it indicates also other characteristics than thin nails, it should not be used to indicate this. The affected digits should be specified.

comment: Congenital vertical talus is characterized by pes valgus, a rigid flatfoot deformity (as opposed to a flexible calcaneovalgus foot) caused by a malpositioned navicular bone at the neck of the talus; the ankle is in severe equinus and the forefoot in dorsiflexion, rocker bottom-like, accompanied by contraction of the talonavicular, deltoid and calcaneal cuboidal ligaments. The foot examination usually reveals a rigid foot with a "reversed" arch, a convex plantar surface, and a deep crease on the lateral dorsal side of the foot. The ankle joint is plantarflexed, while the midfoot and forefoot are extended upward. Lateral foot radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

comment: Metatarsus varus (adductus) is one of the most common foot deformities, that is defined as a transverse plane deformity in Lisfranc's (tarsometatarsal) joints in which the metatarsals are deviated medially. The relationship between talus and calcaneus is normal. On inspection the toes angle abruptly towards the midline, creating a C-shaped lateral foot border with a prominent styloid process of the 5th metatarsal. The result is that the forefoot is twisted inwards relative to the heel, so that the sole faces the midline.

comment: This term differs from Partial absence of the toe because in that term the phalanx must be missing, whereas here it may be small, but present. Relative shortening of the distal phalanges of the toes can be harder to assess than in the fingers, as they are normally quite short. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build.

Folate deficiency leads to an impairment of DNA synthesis such that the cell cycle cannot progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis stage, in turn leading to continuing cell growth without division, which presents as macrocytosis.

comment: Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

comment: MERGED COMMENT:\nTARGET COMMENT: Normally, decreased glucose production leads to increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones.  Thus, ketones provide an indication of whether the hypoglycemia is a result of inadequate production or overutilization of glucose (which tends to be associated with low plasma ketone levels). Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism.\n--------------------\nSOURCE COMMENT: A good starting point for evaluating hypoglycemia is to divide patients into ketotic or non-ketotic.  Normal physiologic response to decreased glucose production is increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones.  Ketones provide an indirect indication of whether hypoglycemia is the result of inadequate production or of over-utilization of glucose (insulin-induced over-utilization, associated with low urine or plasma ketones).  The history of the relationship of the hypoglycemia to feeding is often helpful. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism.  Patients with defects in glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, or fatty acid oxidation tend to tolerate short-term fasting much better.

comment: Homocystine is a disulfide derivate of homocysteine (a precursor of cysteine). Patients with homocystinuria have a clinical phenotype similar to that of patients affected by Marfan syndrome (pectus excavatum, dislocated lenses, etc). This term does not describe the disease entity, but rather the finding of an increased concentration of homocystine in urine, which can be easily detected by a sensitive test for disulphide compounds (the cyanide-nitroprusside reaction) and using chromatographic techniques. Homocystinuria can be caused by biochemical defects including cystathionine B-synthase deficiency, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocystine methyltransferase deficiency, N5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and methhylcobalamin deficiency.

In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.

Leukodystrophy should be distinguished from leukoencephalopathy (defect causing secondary myelin damage).

A hamartoma of the hypothalamus appears as a non-enhancing mass in the floor of the third ventricle posterior to the optic chiasm that is isointense to grey matter on T1 and T2 pulse sequences of an MRI, but may have distinct intensity on FLAIR (neither cranial CT examination nor cranial ultrasound examination is adequate for diagnosis of hypothalamic hamartom). Individuals with hypothalamic hamartomas may have neurologic symptoms, although most are asymptomatic. Removal of the hypothalamic hamartoma is not indicated and often results in iatrogenic pituitary insufficiency.

comment: This sign is observed upon magnetic resonance tomography (MRI).

Myotonia can be elicited by voluntary muscle contraction of by muscle percussion (e.g., by tapping the thenar eminence). During physical examination, myotonia may be elicited by asking the patient to make a tight fist and then quickly open the hand. Myotonia is caused by an abnormality in the muscle membrane, i.e., of the ion channels that control the contraction of muscle fibers.

comment: Normal values of intracranial pressure in adults are around 7-15 mm Hg in the supine position. The term pseudotumor cerebri (also: idiopathic intracranial hypertension or benign intracranial hypertension) is the presence of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a brain tumor or other identifiable cause. It should be coded using this term and negations of appropriate other HPO terms. Increased intracranial pressure can damage tissue, contribute to hydrocephalus, cause brain herniation, and restrict blood supply to the brain.

comment: Reflexes are sensorimotor arcs that require some type of sensory (afferent) signal, and some motor response. While the simplest of reflexes involve direct synapse between the sensory fiber and the motor neuron (monosynaptic), many reflexes have several neurons interposed (polysynaptic reflexes). Hyporeflexia can result from a defect anywhere in this chain.

It results in abnormal obtuseness of the basal angle that can be demonstrated radiographically. If platybasia is associated with basilar invagination, compression of the brainstem and upper cervical cord can result.

AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1).

def: "An impairment of the class-switch recombination process that normally leads B lymphocytes to produce IgG, IgA, or IgE." [HPO:probinson, pmid:11544001]
comment: The generation of the antibody repertoire requires two successive steps. The first is antigen- and T-cell-independent; it takes place in the fetal liver and the bone marrow. Immature B lymphocytes rearrange their immunoglobulin-gene variable segments (V segments), diversity segments (D segments) and joining segments (J segments), producing a functionally integrated VDJ segment linked to the mu constant region (C-mu), which determines the primary antibody repertoire composed of IgM antibodies. The second step is antigen- and T-cell-dependent and takes place in secondary lymphoid organs. After encountering antigen, B cells proliferate and form germinal centers. In this unique anatomic formation, two genetic events lead to generation of the secondary antibody repertoire: class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR of immunoglobulins occurs by a recombination process between two different switch regions (S regions) located upstream of each C region. Replacement of C-mu by a constant region of another class of immunoglobulin (C-gamma, C-alpha or C-epsilon) ensues and leads to the production of IgG, IgA or IgE.

def: "Prolongation of the time taken for a standardized skin cut of fixed depth and length to stop bleeding." [DDD:mumford]
comment: The bleeding time test measures the time taken for blood vessel constriction and platelet plug formation to occur. No clot is allowed to form, so that the arrest of bleeding depends exclusively on blood vessel constriction and platelet action. To perform the test, pressure is maintained throughout the test by inflating a sphygmomanometer cuff on the upper arm. The dorsal surface of the forearm is then cleaned, and the bleeding time device placed onto the skin  and the trigger is depressed. At 30-second intervals, the flow of blood is blotted with filter paper. The time from puncture to cessation of bleeding is then recorded as the bleeding time. Normal values depend on the device used and other parameters, but are around 2 to 9 minutes.

comment: A  nerve conduction study (NCS) is commonly conducted together with electromyography in order to evaluate muscle disorders. For the NCS, dermal electrodes are placed at intervals over the nerve to be examined, and a low-intensity current is introducted to generate action potentials. The velocity of the action potential is related to the diameter of the nerve fiber and the presence of a myelin sheath. Diseases of the myelin sheath characteristically reduce the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The amplitude of the response is also measured.

In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted.

comment: Accumulation of intracellular autofluorescent material or aging pigment has been characterized as a normal aging event. Lipofuscin (from the Greek word for fat and the Latin word for dark), refers to intracellular autofluorescent material that accumulates in aging cells with a excitation wavelength between 320 and 480 nm and an emission wavelength between 460 and 630 nm. Lpofuscin consists of a mixture of oxidized proteins and lipids, carbohydrates and trace amount of metals. Ceroid iss a lipofuscin-like lipopigment that arises from pathological conditions such as disease, malnutrition, and cell stress. Subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase makes up approximately 40% of this lipopigment/ceroid accumulation.

Over 120 different fragile sites have been identified in the human genome. Some of these sites are sensitive to folate, that is, they can be induced by a culture medium deficient in folic acid and thymidine, and hence a medium with lowered levels of dTTP or dCTP, two immediate components of DNA, or by a medium enriched either in methotrexate, an inhibitor of folate metabolism, or in fluorodeoxyuridine, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthesis. The folate-dependent fragile phenotype occurs if more than a critical number of CCG/CGG repeats are present (e.g., > 230 repeats for FRAXA).

comment: Regitine produces an alpha-adrenergic block of relatively short duration. In the regitine blocking test, regitine is injected rapidly and bood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. A positive response to the reginitine blocking test is present when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A positive response is suggestive of pheochromocytoma and should generally be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures such as measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites.

Congenital abnormalities are often but not always hereditary in nature. Whether a disease manifestation is diagnosed to be intrauterine or congenital may depend on the time at which diagnostic procedures are performed. Thus, most congenital abnormalities are also intrauterine.

Histochemical stains such as toluidine blue and Alcian blue can be used to detect such intracellular glycosaminoglycans which, being negatively charged, are bound and precipitated by the cationic dyes. Cultured fibroblasts from homozygotes -and heterozygotes for the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses accumulate excessive quantities of glycosaminoglycans. The cytoplasmic staining with toluidine blue is referred to as metachromasia (pink) and orthochromasia (blue) and that with Alcian blue as alcianophilia.

Epiphyseal plates are located at the distal and proximal ends of the long bones, in this case of the radius and premature fusion will have an effect on the growh of the radial bone, inhibiting or at least disturbing the normal growth and development of the bone." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The epiphyseal plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate) is a hyaline cartilage plate in the metaphysis at each end of a long bone. The plate is found in children and adolescents; in adults, who have stopped growing, the plate is replaced by an epiphyseal line. The growth plate has a very specific morphology in having a zonal arrangement. The growth plate includes a relatively inactive reserve zone at the epiphyseal end, moving distally into a proliferative and then hyper trophic zone and ending with a band of ossifying cartilage (the metaphysis).

The increased girth is accompanied by an increase in the dorso-ventral dimension AND the lateral dimension of the digit." [pmid:19125433]
comment: There are no recognized standards for the girth of digits and this finding can vary substantially in the population. This assessment relies on the judgment of the examiner to recognize when the difference between the expected and the observed is significant. The affected digits should be specified. The definition does not mandate the component of the increased size (bone, connective tissue, etc.), but should exclude edema. The requirement that the girth is most, or all, of the digit is intended to distinguish this from broad fingertips. This should be distinguished from Broad fingers or Broad fingertips as the girth is circumferential in macrodactyly, which is not the case for broad fingers or broad fingertips, which are increased only (or predominantly) in their lateral (A/P) width.

comment: This term refers to a developmental finding resulting in short palms. This term is reserved for individuals with shortening of all four metacarpals 2-5. Individuals with fewer than four shortened metacarpals (in a eudactylous hand, the metacarpals of F2-5) should be coded as Metacarpal, short. See the entry for Hand, small for a discussion of this finding. "Short hand" should not be used as it is a bundle of two readily separable terms, Fingers, short (which, as noted above, can itself be a bundled term) and Palm, short.

comment: Palm width is measured across the palm at the level of the MCPJ (radial aspect of the F2 MCPJ to the ulnar aspect of the F5 MCPJ). Norms are specified in [Hall et al., 2007]. Caution is advised for the subjective assessment as the breadth may be in the normal range with disproportionately increased length, which appears narrow. This finding may be associated with elongated/slender limbs in general, but that finding does not bear on the coding of this feature. Proximal narrowing may indicate small thenar or hypothenar eminences. This term replaces "narrow hands" as that term may leave the impression that it includes the thumb, which it does not.

The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex).

comment: Preauricular cysts and sinuses are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear. The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.

Inability to maximally concentrate the urine is related to one or both of two basic tubular defects: 1) a failure of maximal free-water generation by the diluting segment in the ascending limb of Henle's loop; and 2) a failure of the distal tubular epithelium to achieve maximum permeability to water during water deprivation.

comment: The ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular because of the large number of atrial impulses that transit the atrioventricular node, making the ventricle partially refractory to further impulses. Atrial fibrillation can cause a number of manifestations including excessive ventricular response with angina pectoris or hypotension in susceptible individuals, syncope, systemic embolization, fatigue, or anxiety. These features should be coded separately.

A depressed nasal bridge can occur irrespective of the width of the nasal bridge, and the width should be assessed independently. In infancy, the nasal bridge is relatively more posterior than in the older person. The term depressed nasal bridge should only be used when the bridge is more posterior than is typical for age and ethnic background.

This finding may or may not be accompanied by Brachycephaly (which should be coded separately), and may be observed more frequently when an infant is placed to sleep on his/her back. Occipital plagiocephaly can result from fusion or sclerosis of the lambdoid suture. If unilateral, this is accompanied by unilateral occipital flattening and bulging of the ispilateral frontal bone.

comment: DIC is a complex syndrome in which there is pathological generation of thrombin and diffuse intravascular clot formation. DIC may occur as acute decompensated or chronic compensated form. In acute decompensated DIC, there is a sudden massive exposure of tissue factor over a brief time period; Intravascular coagulation can also compromise the blood supply to organs and, in conjunction with hemodynamic and metabolic derangements, may contribute to the failure of multiple organs. At the same time, the use and subsequent depletion of platelets and coagulation proteins resulting from the ongoing coagulation may induce severe bleeding. Chronic DIC, also known as compensated DIC, results from a persistent weak or intermittent activating stimulus. Under such conditions, destruction and production of coagulation factors and platelets are balanced.

The necrosis is characteristically associated with flattening of the femoral head, for which reason the term coxa plana has been used to refer to this feature in the medical literature." [HPO:probinson]
comment: In medical parlance, this is often referred to as Legg Calve Perthes disease. Here, the name 'Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis' is preferred to emphasize that the term refers to a phenotypic feature rather than a disease entity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may result in pain in the hip, limp, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and some degree of atrophy of the affected leg. The phrase Legg Perthes syndrome or Legg Calve Perthes disease is also used to refer to a number of diseases, including the idiopathic form and a form that is related to mutation in the COL2A1 gene (MIM 150600). Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 to 10 years old, and is clinically characterized by limping, hip stiffness, limited range of motion, and can result in restriction of growth of the affected leg and wasting of the muscles of the upper thigh.

The cushions then fuse and are remodeled to form the atrioventricular valves and septa. Failure of this process results in AVSD, with the degree of severity dependent on the stage at which the developmental failure occurs. AVSD are a spectrum of cardiac malformations that result in a persistent common atrioventricular canal.

Clinical studies generally use electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves to elicit potentials. SSEP testing determines whether peripheral sensory nerves are able to transmit sensory information like pain, temperature, and touch to the brain. Abnormal SSEPs can result from dysfunction at the level of the peripheral nerve, plexus, spinal root, spinal cord, brain stem, thalamocortical projections, or primary somatosensory cortex."

It is a descriptive term, not a specific diagnosis or disorder (as such, it is a syndrome). Affected babies are born in a collodion membrane, a shiny waxy outer layer to the skin. This is shed 10-14 days after birth, revealing the main symptom of the disease, extensive scaling of the skin caused by hyperkeratosis. With increasing age, the scaling tends to be concentrated around joints in areas such as the groin, the armpits, the inside of the elbow and the neck.

[HPO:probinson, pmid:17698200]
comment: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by infarction of the laminar or retrolaminar portion of the optic nerve head supplied by the short posterior ciliary arteries. Clinically NAION is characterized by sudden, usually painless, loss of vision in one or both eyes. Examination findings include decreased visual acuity, a visual field defect, decreased colour vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc swelling.

comment: The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.

comment: The simultaneous occurrence a low thyroid hormone level and a normal or low serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in a patient with hypothyroidism establishes the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism. The administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which is normally synthesized and released by the hypothalamus, enables the physician to distinguish between pituitary and hypothalamic causes of hypothyroidism.\nTRH will normally cause the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. When the hypothalamus does not synthesize or release TRH, the administration of exogenous TRH will result in prompt rise of serum TSH. To date, the cases reported of pituitary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism, on the other hand, may either be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease.

def: "A decrease in the strength of the diaphragm." [HPO:probinson, pmid:2509822]
comment: Diaphragmatic paralysis is an extreme form of diaphragmatic weakness. Weakness of the diaphragm can result from abnormalities at any site along its neuromuscular axis, although it most frequently arises from diseases in the phrenic nerves or from myopathies affecting the diaphragm itself. Presence of diaphragmatic weakness may be suspected from the complaint of dyspnea (particularly on exertion) or orthopnea; or the presence of rapid, shallow breathing or, more importantly, paradoxical inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration on physical examination.

comment: Thumb placement index greater than 0.55; or, the base of the thumb appears closer to the wrist than is typical. The technique for the thumb placement index is described in detail [Malina et al., 1973; Hall et al., 2007]. Briefly, the thumb placement index is the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the angle of the first interdigital space divided by the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the wrist flexion crease at the base of the thumb. This term should not be used with Preaxial polydactyly.

comment: This term differs from Partial absence of the finger because in that term, the phalanx must be missing, whereas in this term it may be small, but present. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build. Regarding the subjective definition, for individuals who do not have flexion creases, one may determine this by flexing the DIP joint and estimating the length of the terminal segment of the digit. Alternatively, one may be able to palpate the joint.

comment: This feature gives the appearance of a tall forehead, and may or may not include reduction of hair in the temporal areas.

In addition, texture of the skin of the scalp differs from the texture of the skin over the forehead.

def: "Height of the vermilion of the medial part of the lower lip more than 2 SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the lower lip in the frontal view (subjective)." [pmid:19125428]
comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981] but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip varies considerably among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. If the lower lip vermilion is thin, the inferior border of the vermilion is less curved, and on a profile view, the lower lip vermilion is less convex than usual.

comment: Spinal dysraphism, or neural tube defect comprises a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass. The anatomic features common to the entire group is an anomaly in the midline structures of the back, especially the absence of some of the neural arches, and defects of the skin, filum terminale, nerves, and spinal cord. Open forms of spinal dysraphism include myelocele, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. These open forms are often associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II and may be classified as spina bifida aperta. Closed forms of spinal dysraphism includ spina bifida occulta.

comment: A developmental defect resulting in the presence of a thyroglossal cyst, a fibrous cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct. During the embryologic development of the thyroid gland, the precursor of the thyroid migrates from the base of the tongue inferiorly though the thyroglossal duct. This duct normally disappears following the development and migration of the thyroid gland, but if a portion of the duct remain it can form a thyroglossal cyst.

[pmid:19125433]
comment: We have set an arguably arbitrary threshold to distinguish the object form the subjective finding. While severe degrees of cutaneous syndactyly are clearly objective, more subtle degrees are subjective. We set this threshold to distinguish these two situations. The digits (or parts of) are joined together by tissue that is not normally present between the digits at that point in the P/D axis. A modifier of "complete" may be used if the cutaneous syndactyly extends to the distal end of the nail bed of the digits. The affected digits should be specified. Note that the unqualified term "syndactyly" is no longer allowed as it is unclear whether this refers to bony or cutaneous syndactyly.

def: "Elevated `7-dehydrocholesterol` (CHEBI:17759) levels." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels occur as the result of a deficiency of the enzyme delta-7-sterol reductase, the penultimate enzyme of mammalian sterol biosynthesis that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This enzyme removes the C(7-8) double bond introduced by the sterol delta8-delta7 isomerases. In addition, its role in drug-induced malformations is known: inhibitors of the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis such as AY9944 and BM15766 severely impair brain development. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding for this enzyme are the molecular genetic cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome.

comment: Phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl hexadecanoic acid) is a fatty acid that is derived from chlorophyll and present in the diet. The metabolism of phytanic acid involves alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, which converts phytanic acid to pristanic acid. Peroxisomes involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid. Peroxisomal malfunctioning can lead to over-accumulation of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, among other things.

Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.

name: Mirror image polydactyly
def: "A hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable A/P axis of symmetry. The axis can lie within a normally formed or partially duplicated digit resembling a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe, or hallux. Alternatively, the axis can be in an interdigital space with a flanking pair of digits that resemble a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe or hallux. The most lateral digits on each side of the hand typically resemble fifth fingers/toes." [HPO:sdoelken, pmid:19125433]
comment: Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.

comment: During lens terminal differentiation, the originally cuboidal lens vesicle cells elongate into long fiber-like cells, or fibers. Y-shaped sutures form because of how the lens epithelial cells proliferate during formation. The Y sutures demarcate the boundaries between the lens cortex, which is peripheral to the Y sutures, and the lens nucleus, which is within and includes the Y sutures. The anterior Y suture is oriented upright, and the posterior Y suture is inverted.

comment: Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads. Most of these atrophic patients do not go through a hypertrophic phase. Multiple attacks of eyelid edema result in thinning, stretching, and atrophy of eyelid tissues. The eyelid skin becomes redundant, discolored, and atrophic, appearing like wrinkled cigarette paper. The upper eyelids are more commonly affected, but the lower eyelids may also be involved.

def: "The presence during the prenatal period of a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts near the posterior aspect of the neck. Fetal cystic hygroma can be defined as nuchal translucency with or without septations measuring greater than 3.0 mm." [emedicine:402757, HPO:probinson]
comment: Upon ultrasound examination, fetal cystic hygroma presents as a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts related to the posterior aspect of the neck. Cystic hygromas can range from increased nuchal translucency to thin-walled cystic masses that may become larger than the fetal head. The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.

comment: Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.

comment: This phenotype is characterized by fiberglasslike or needlelike crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Some crystals may be 11 mm in length, and their biochemical composition is not known. This type of cataract is considered to be different from the corraliform cataract, which does not show the needlelike projections. This opacity does not appear to respect the sutures or the direction of the lens fibers (Francois 1963) and appears to originate from the fetal and postnatal nuclei, suggesting a congenital origin with some postnatal progression, if any.

comment: The renal pelvis is the part of the kidney that collects urine. Fetal pyelectasis is a prenatal ultrasound finding that is diagnosed with enlargement of the renal pelvis from 4 to 10 millimeters. In many cases, fetal pyelectasis resolves spontaneously. Note that dilatation of the renal pelvis to more than 10 mm is referred to as severe pyelectasis or hydronephrosis.

Functional closure, which is followed by anatomic closure, is virtually complete within a few weeks of birth. The typical abnormal finding in abnormal ductus venosus flow is a reversed a-wave.

Measurements are obtained from an axial plane at the level of the thalamic nuclei just below the standard image to measure the BPD (pmid:16100637)." [HPO:probinson, pmid:16100637]
comment: A ventricular atrial diameter of more than 10 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation has been accepted as defining ventriculomegaly because it represents at least 3 standard deviations above the mean (which is roughly 5 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation). If the diameter is above 15 mm, the ventriculomegaly is considered to be severe. Amongst the most common causes of ventriculomegaly are impaired absorption of CSF, developmental cerebral defects, and destroyed brain tissue.

comment: The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors. Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former. Note that this term does not refer to the situation in which two rows of teeth are seen at the time of eruption of permanent dentition before exfoliation of primary teeth, which can be a normal finding.

One or more\nepileptic seizures may occur in the context of a brain insult (systemic, toxic, or metabolic). These events (defined acute symptomatic seizures, provoked seizures, or situation-related seizures) are presumed to be an acute\nmanifestation of the insult and may not recur when the underlying cause has been removed or the acute phase\nhas elapsed.

Note that the synonym "fetal fingertip pads" should not be interpreted to mean that the prominent pad necessarily was present in this individual since fetal life. We do not endorse the use of the term "Persistent fetal pads" as this term implies knowledge of the natural history of this finding, which may or may not be known.

It may be difficult to determine which phalanx is absent without x-rays and even then, there are circumstances where the missing bone may not be exactly identified (note that no attempt is made to distinguish missing middle from proximal phalanges). In this situation the location adjective will have to be removed. This finding is distinct from Short fingers.

comment: The middle ear comprises the tympanic cavity in the temporal bone of the skull behind the eardrum, and is separated from the outer ear by the ear drum. The tympanic cavity contains the auditory ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) that vibrate when exposed to sound, forming a chain that extends to the oval window of the inner ear and whose main function is to amplify sound. Additionally, the middle ear connects to the back of the throat and nose through the Eustachian tube.

Corneal neovascularization may be a consequence of corneal hypoxia. Neovascular patterns can be separated into three clinical groups: deep neovascularization overlying Descemet's membrane (seen in herpetic and luetic interstitial keratitis), stromal neovascularization (as a result of stromal keratitis), and vascular pannus (from ocular surface disorders).

comment: The lesions are variable in size and location, and frequently follow the course of a major retinal vein. Epiretinal membranes are a common feature. In contrast to retinal capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas lack prominent feeder vessels, intraretinal exudate, and surrounding subretinal fluid. Because the fundoscopic features are characteristic, diagnosis can generally be made based upon clinical appearance.

def: "The left atrio-ventricular connection consists of two anatomically distinct orifices separated by accessory fibrous tissue." [DDD:dbrown, HPO:probinson, pmid:20851840]
comment: In about 50% of Double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) cases, valvular function is normal, others present with stenosis or regurgitation. In most cases, a larger orifice is accompanied by a small eccentric accessory orifice, and some show duplicated mitral valves. Embryologically, the lesion results from abnormal leaflet fusion and persistence of the left part of the common atrio-ventricular canal.

comment: The normal aortic arch crosses the left mainstem bronchus and descends in the left paravertebral gutter. The coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses. The first branch of the aorta is normally the right brachiocephalic artery, then the left common carotid artery, then the left subclavian artery. Abnormal branching refers to any deviance from the norm of the origin or course of these branches or the proximal vertebral arteries. An anomaly of the aortic arch that results in complete encirclement of the trachea and oesophagus by vascular structures is a vascular ring.

name: Right ventricular cardiomyopathy
def: "Right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional) with functional and morphological right ventricular abnormalities, with or without left ventricular disease." [HPO:probinson, pmid:17916581]
comment: This feature is most often seen in the disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is defined histologically by the presence of progressive replacement of right ventricular myocardium with adipose and fibrous tissue often confined to a triangle of dysplasia comprising the right ventricular inflow, outflow, and apex. While these pathologic abnormalities can result in functional and morphological right ventricular abnormalities, they also occur in the left ventricle, producing a DCM phenotype, or can be present in the absence of clinically detectable structural changes in either ventricle. For the purposes of this classification, ARVC is defined by the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional), with or without left ventricular disease, in the presence of histological evidence for the disease and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities in accordance with published criteria.

comment: The sternum develops from two cartilaginous bars, situated one on either side of the median plane and connected with the cartilages of the upper nine ribs of its own side. During development, the two cartilaginous bars fuse with each other to form the cartilaginous sternum. This in turn is ossified from six centers: one in the manubrium, four in the body of the sternum, and one in the xiphoid process.

comment: Thumb placement index greater than 0.55; or, the base of the thumb appears closer to the wrist than is typical. The technique for the thumb placement index is described in detail [Malina et al., 1973; Hall et al., 2007]. Briefly, the thumb placement index is the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the angle of the first interdigital space divided by the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the wrist flexion crease at the base of the thumb. This term should not be used with Preaxial polydactyly.

def: "A congenital inclusion cysts that arises from the inclusion of ectodermally committed cells at the time of neural tube closure (3rd-5th week of embryogenesis). The capsule of dermoid cysts consists of simple epithelium supported by collagen. In thicker parts, the lining is supplemented with dermis containing hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and apocrine glands." [HPO:probinson, pmid:16714456]
comment: See Figure 9 in pmid:16714456. These cysts increase in size by means of glandular secretion and epithelial desquamation. Growth can lead to rupture of the cyst contents, causing a chemical meningitis that may lead to vasospasm, infarction, and even death.

comment: The internal carotid begins at the bifurcation of the common carotid, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and runs perpendicularly upward. It supplies the anterior part of the brain, the eye and its appendages, and sends branches to the forehead and nose. Interstitial hemorrhage into the media of the vessel wall can lead to occlusion of the internal carotid artery and aneurysm formation.

def: "A clinical sign indicating a lapse of posture and is usually manifest by a bilateral flapping tremor at the wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and hip joints." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The examiner can test for asterixis by asking the patient to extend the arms, spread the fingers, dorsiflex the wrist and observe for the abnormal "flapping" tremor at the wrist. Asterixis represents the failure to actively maintain a position and is caused by the abnormal function of diencephalic motor centers that regulate the tone of the agonist and antagonist muscles involved in maintaining posture.

comment: The protein C pathway is a major anticoagulant mechanism that down-regulates the prothrombin- and intrinsic factor X (FX)-activating complexes via inactivation of their respective cofactors, activated factors V (FVa) and VIII (FVIIIa). Cofactor inactivation occurs by limited proteolysis at certain amino acid positions in FVa  and in FVIIIa. These reactions are catalyzed by the serine protease activated protein C (APC) and stimulated by the APC cofactor protein S. Functional defects of the protein C pathway determine a plasma phenotype known as APC resistance, which is a prevalent and important risk factor for venous thrombosis. A plasma is termed 'APC resistant' when the addition of exogenous APC fails to prolong its clotting time in an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay.

comment: Renal clearance is defined as the volume of plasma per minute needed to excrete the quantity of a solute appearing in the urine in a minute. Normal values for adults are 97 to 137 ml/min (male) and 88 to 128 ml/min (female). This term refers to a reduction below normal limits in the ability of the kidney to clear creatinine from the bloodstream.

def: "Any anomaly of the normal motility of motile cilia. Evaluation of ciliary beat frequency and ciliary beat pattern requires high-speed videomicroscopy of freshly obtained ciliary biopsies that are maintained in culture media under controlled conditions." [HPO:probinson, pmid:19606528, pmid:20301301]
comment: Ciliated epithelial cells bear approximately 200 motile (9 + 2) cilia that move with both intracellular and intercellular synchrony. The pattern of beat in 9 + 2 motile cilia occurs in a waveform having a forward effective stroke followed by a return stroke. The direction of stroke is a function of the directional orientation of the central microtubules. In addition to moving in synchrony, individual cilia in normal cells are very plastic and move fluidly, sometimes deforming briefly upon encountering resistance and/or particles being transported over the mucosal surface. Cilia are embedded in a watery periciliary fluid of low viscosity, which facilitates the rapid beat cycle to move the more viscous overlying layer of mucus. Ciliary beat frequency ranges from approximately 8-20 Hz under normal conditions but may be accelerated by exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke.

Note that pubarche refers to the development of pubic hair, axillary hair, and adult sweat gland (apocrine) odor. The physical features associated with pubarche reflect the onset of adrenarche, which refers to the pubertal maturation of the adrenal and is associated with increased secretion of an adrenal hormone called dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).

def: "Reduced motility through the `sphincter of Oddi` (FMA:15077), resulting in impedance of bile and pancreatic juice flow from the common bile duct into the duodenum." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The sphincter of Oddi (also known as sphincter of ampulla) is a muscular valve that controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the ampulla of Vater into the second part of the duodenum. Increased tone of the sphincter or disturbance in the coordination of contraction of the biliary ducts prevents normal emptying of the biliary tree. This may result in biliary pain, common bile duct dilation and episodes of pancreatitis.

def: "An anomaly of the intracellular membrane complexes known as the dense tubular system." [DDD:wouwehand, pmid:1322202]
comment: The dense tubular system (DTS) functions to regulate platelet activation by sequestering or releasing calcium, similar to the sarcotubules of skeletal muscle. In resting platelets, the DTS exists as thin elongated membranes. Within 10 seconds of the addition of thrombin, platelets show a major ultrastructural change in their DTS: from the thin elongated form to a rounded vesicular form.

comment: Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Atresia (TOF/PA) is a complex lesion with many different anatomic variants. The primary source of variability in this lesion is in the anatomy of the pulmonary arteries, with the spectrum ranging from well-formed, confluent pulmonary artery branches to completely absent native pulmonary arteries and major aorto-pulmonary collaterals (MAPCA's) providing all the pulmonary blood flow. The majority of cases fall somewhere in between these two ends of the spectrum, with the total pulmonary blood flow provided by a combination of diminutive native pulmonary arteries and multiple MAPCA.

name: Skewed maternal X inactivation
def: "A deviation from equal (50%) inactivation of each parental X chromosome in maternal cells." [HPO:probinson, pmid:18097476]
comment: X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the process  by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in females is inactivated in order to achieves dosage equivalency for X-linked genes between XY males and XX females. An individual cell's decision to inactivate either the paternal or maternal X is made early in development, at approximately the time of implantation, such that normally there is a roughly equal distribution of either X being active. A deviation from equality is known as skewing, with common criteria for "skewed" inactivation being arbitrarily defined as the observation of inactivation of the same allele in 75% or 80% of cells (and very skewed inactivation resulting in 90% or 95% of cells with the same allele inactive). For some X-linked diseases there is strong selection in the heterozygous carrier in favor of cells bearing the mutation on the silenced inactive X, and thus, assessment of XCI skewing in female family members can be suggestive of carrier status.

name: Absent neutrophil specific granules
def: "Lack of specific granules in neutrophils." [HPO:probinson, pmid:6155073]
comment: Neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) contain two principal types of granules. Azurophil granules appear early in neutrophil development and contain lysosomal enzymes, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specific granules are formed later, lack MPO and hydrolases, but contain lactoferrin and the remainder of the cell's complement of lysozyme. Consequently, specific granules may be conveniently detected at the electron-microscopic (EM) level by the cytochemical demonstration of their lack of MPO, while at the optical level their presence can be inferred from their positive immunocytochemical staining for lactoferrin with the use of specific antiserums.

def: "Deposition of fibrillar material that can be found on all anterior segment structures bathed by aqueous humor." [HPO:probinson, pmid:23157966]
comment: In the eye, pseudoexfoliation syndrome is characterized by the deposition of fibrillar material that can be found on all anterior segment structures bathed by aqueous humor. PXM can be observed in vivo during slit lamp examination. It appears as 'dandruff-like' material in the anterior chamber or most characteristically on the anterior lens capsule deposited in a double concentric ring pattern. The rings are separated by a clear zone presumably created because of the movement of the iris on the anterior lens surface. The central ring is located at the area of the iris sphincter, while the peripheral ring is only visible after pupil dilation. PXM is also often observed by slit lamp examination at the pupillary margin, on the lens zonules and on the trabecular meshwork. The site of production of this material which is a complex of various glycoproteins is unclear, but PXM can potentially originate from the iris, lens epithelium, ciliary body, or the trabecular meshwork.

name: Tics
def: "A tic is a sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization involving discrete muscle groups." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

name: Pseudo-fractures
def: "A band of bone material of decreased density forming alongside the surface of the cortical bone with thickening of the periosteum. Callus formation in the affected area is common and gives the appearance of a false fracture." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Typical sites of involvement are the axillary margins of the scapula, ribs, pubic rami, proximal ends of the femur and ulna. On x-rays pseudo-fractures appear as a lucent line about 1 -2 cm wide, vertical to the cortex and are pathognomonic of osteomalacia, seen on the concave side and are also seen in Paget disease on the convex side of the bone.

comment: A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).

There is a tendency for recurrence in the setting of prior surgery and the most common localisation of these tumors is intraabdominal from smooth muscle cells of the instestine." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Approximately 10% of individuals with Gardner's syndrome, a type of FAP with extracolonic features, have desmoid tumors.\nRisk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female gender, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history and a history of previous abdominal surgery.

The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves.

def: "Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that is caused primarily by damage to various areas in the `basal ganglia` (FMA:84013). Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Hemiballismus is a very rare movement disorder. It is five hundred times rarer than Parkinson disease. Its effects can sometimes be severe enough to prevent patients from being able to perform daily functions. It is usually associated with structural brain lesions but can occur with metabolic abnormalities. The symptoms can also decrease while the patient is asleep, unlike some movement disorders.

def: "Senile plaques are extracellular deposits of amyloid in the gray matter of the brain." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Senile plaques can be found in human and animal brains. From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.

Penetrance is reduced and some idnividuals have been observed presenting only with unilateral smaller 2nd toe which may be overlooked till a much more severly affected family member is seen.

Sinuses typically have their external orifice inferior to the ramus of the mandible. They may traverse the parotid gland, and run in close vicinity to the facial nerve in the external auditory canal." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Branchial sinuses have to be distinguished from the preauricular cysts and sinuses, which are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral, and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear.

def: "Gustatory lacrimation results from an aberrant innervation of fibres from the seventh cranial nerve to the pterygopalatine ganglion which are destined originally for the submandibular ganglion. This aberrant innervation leads to uncontrollable tearing while eating or in anticipation of a meal." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The aberrant innervation leading to this phenomenon may be seen for example as a hereditary trait in some patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome in which case it may occur unilateral or bilateral, but it may also result from a secondary aberrant reinnervation following a peripheral facial palsy, in which case it is associated with uncontrollable ipsilateral tearing. In the past gustatory lacrimation was considered to be a very rare non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation but rare occurences in patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have shown, that this feature may also appear as a hereditary condition.

comment: Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.

comment: Many such conditions are considered likely to be caused by autoimmune conditions, rather than directly due to infection, although autoimmune conditions can be activated or exacerbated by infections. It is also a documented side effect of the lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates. Elevation of creatine kinase in blood is indicative of myositis.

comment: Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.

comment: Esophageal duplication is a rare cause of mediastinal mass. An esophageal duplication may be a simple epithelial cyst or duplication that contains muscle and submucosa but not epithelium. In most cases, the duplication is located in the lower thrid of the esophagus, and the most common associated symptom is difficulty in swallowing. Esophageal duplication occurs because of maldevelopment of the posterior division of embryonic foregut.

comment: Normally, lateral rotation of the tibia increases from approximately 5º at birth to approximately 15º at maturity. Tibial torsion is the most common cause of intoeing. In a study by Mullaji et al to determine tibial torsion norms, individuals in India were found to have less tibial torsion than Caucasians but about the same amount as the Japanese population. The differences in normal tibial torsion values are expected to be caused by the different lifestyles and postures of the different populations, such as cross-legged sitting positions.

def: "A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.

comment: This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. The prime cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death. Diabetes and long-term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene. There are different types of gangrene with different symptoms, such as dry gangrene, wet gangrene, gas gangrene, internal gangrene and necrotising fasciitis. Treatment options include debridement (or, in severe cases, amputation) of the affected body parts, antibiotics, vascular surgery, maggot therapy or hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

A nevus mucinosis is a lesion in which an alteration in the amount of dermal glycosaminoglycan is present. The name nevus mucinosis is also used for lesions in which an alteration in more than one dermal component is present. Connective tissue nevi may be solitary or multiple, sporadic or inherited. They may occur as isolated skin lesions, or they may be associated with a number of syndromes.
